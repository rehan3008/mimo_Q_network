Overview
This repository implements a novel framework for offline RL that combines uncertainty-aware learning with a rank-one MIMO Q network. The goal is to enable agents to learn high-quality policies from static data without interacting with the environment. The uncertainty-aware component helps the agent recognize when estimates are unreliable, which reduces overfitting to spurious correlations in offline data. The rank-one MIMO structure provides a compact, efficient representation for multi-dimensional actions and observations, enabling scalable learning even on modest hardware.

The project targets researchers and practitioners who want to push offline RL further with robust uncertainty handling and efficient network architectures. It is designed to be modular, so users can swap components, experiment with different uncertainty estimators, or plug in new offline RL objectives.

Core Concepts
- Uncertainty-Aware Q Networks: Networks that quantify epistemic uncertainty in Q-value predictions and use that information to guide learning and policy improvement.
- Rank-One MIMO Architecture: A factorized approach to multi-input multi-output networks that reduces parameter count while preserving expressive power.
- Offline Reinforcement Learning: Learning policies from a fixed dataset without online interaction, with an emphasis on safe and stable learning.
- Stability Through Uncertainty: Regularization and training protocols that leverage uncertainty estimates to prevent over-optimistic updates.

Why This Project
- Improve sample efficiency in offline RL by using a compact MIMO Q network that can capture complex relationships in high-dimensional state-action spaces.
- Increase robustness to distribution shift using principled uncertainty estimation.
- Provide an end-to-end pipeline from data handling to training, evaluation, and reproducibility.
- Offer clear documentation and modular code so researchers can reproduce results and build on the work.

Architecture and Design
This project uses a modular architecture designed to be approachable and extensible. The core components are:
- Data Loader: Reads offline datasets, supports common formats, and handles pre-processing steps like normalization and feature extraction.
- Rank-One MIMO Q Network: Implements the main network that factorizes the multi-input multi-output mapping into a rank-one structure for efficiency.
- Uncertainty Estimator: Computes epistemic (and optional aleatoric) uncertainty using methods such as bootstrapping, ensembles, or probabilistic layers.
- Offline Learner: Orchestrates the training loop with stability objectives, regularization, and target networks.
- Evaluator: Provides metrics and evaluation pipelines to compare policy performance on fixed datasets.
- Utilities: Helpers for logging, checkpointing, visualization, and reproducibility.

The codebase emphasizes clarity and simplicity. Each module has a well-defined interface, and defaults are chosen to be safe for common offline RL tasks.

How the MIMO Q Network Works
- Rank-One Factorization: The Q-network is designed to learn a high-dimensional mapping from state-action pairs to expected returns. By factorizing the weight matrix into a product of low-rank components, the network captures cross-feature interactions efficiently.
- Multi-Input Multi-Output: The network processes several streams of information (e.g., different action channels or subspaces) and produces corresponding Q-values. The rank-one factorization reduces parameters while preserving predictive power.
- Uncertainty Quantification: The network estimates uncertainty in Q-values. This helps the planner avoid over-optimistic actions when data is sparse or distribution-shifted. Uncertainty guides both learning updates and exploration of alternative actions in evaluation.

Uncertainty Modeling
- Epistemic Uncertainty: Captures what the model does not know about the data. It is reduced as more data is seen, and high epistemic uncertainty signals the model should be cautious in updates.
- Aleatoric Uncertainty (optional): Captures irreducible noise inherent in the environment. It can be modeled with heteroscedastic outputs or probabilistic layers.
- Techniques to estimate uncertainty:
  - Ensembles: Train several independent Q-networks and aggregate their predictions to estimate spread.
  - Bootstrap Methods: Train networks on bootstrap-resampled subsets of the data.
  - Bayesian Layers: Use probabilistic layers to directly model uncertainty in weights.
  - Dropout as Approximate Bayesian Inference: Use dropout during inference to obtain an uncertainty estimate.
- Using Uncertainty in Learning:
  - Uncertain Q-values can trigger conservative updates, reducing the learning rate for uncertain actions.
  - Action selection uses a risk-adjusted criterion that accounts for both mean estimates and uncertainty.
  - Regularization terms penalize overconfident predictions in regions with limited data.

Offline Reinforcement Learning Primer
- Objective: Learn a policy from a fixed dataset that was collected by some policy in the past.
- Challenges: Distribution shift between the data and the learner‚Äôs policy, evaluation bias, and overfitting to limited data.
- Common approaches:
  - Conservative Q-Learning (CQL): Penalize Q-values for unseen state-action pairs to avoid overestimation.
  - A2C/A3C variants adapted for offline data: Use value-function baselines with stable updates.
  - Imitation elements: Blend expert behavior with learned value estimates to improve safety and performance.
- Why offline RL benefits from uncertainty:
  - It helps distinguish trustworthy estimates from misleading ones in regions with sparse data.
  - It supports safer policy improvements, which is crucial when real-world data collection is expensive or risky.

Data Handling and Datasets
- Data Formats: The framework supports standard offline RL datasets stored as pairs of (state, action, reward, next_state, done) with optional auxiliary features.
- Preprocessing: Normalization, feature scaling, and optional dimensionality reduction are supported. The Data Loader handles shuffling, batching, and sequence segmentation where needed.
- Data Quality: For best results, datasets should cover a diverse set of states and actions. High-quality coverage reduces uncertainty in informationally rich regions.
- Datasets used in examples:
  - Synthetic control tasks to illustrate stability of the rank-one MIMO Q network
  - Realistic offline RL datasets drawn from simulated environments
  - Benchmark suites to compare against established offline RL baselines

Training and Evaluation
- Training Loop:
  1. Load a batch of transitions from the offline dataset
  2. Compute Q-value targets using a target network
  3. Estimate uncertainty for the current batch
  4. Update the rank-one MIMO Q network with a loss that combines mean-squared error for Q-values and a regularization term informed by uncertainty
  5. Periodically update the target network and adjust learning rates
  6. Log metrics and save checkpoints
- Evaluation:
  - Offline evaluation uses held-out data to compute metrics such as mean Q-value, policy disagreement, and policy returns under the fixed dataset
  - If a safe evaluation protocol is available, you can run a conservative policy improvement step and re-evaluate
  - Visualization tools help monitor training progress, including Q-value distributions and uncertainty estimates
- Losses and Objectives:
  - Primary objective: minimize the Bellman error for Q-values
  - Uncertainty regularization: encourage robustness by penalizing overconfident Q-values where data is scarce
  - Rank-one regularization: enforce the low-rank structure to reduce overfitting and control model capacity

Pseudocode for Training
Note: This is high-level pseudocode to illustrate the training flow. Adjust as needed for your environment and data.

- Initialize Q-network with rank-one MIMO architecture
- Initialize target Q-network as a copy of the Q-network
- Initialize uncertainty estimator (e.g., ensembles or Bayesian layers)
- For each training step:
  - Sample a batch of transitions from the offline dataset
  - Compute current Q-values Q(s, a) using the Q-network
  - Compute target Q-values using the target network: y = r + gamma * max_a' Q_target(s', a')
  - Estimate uncertainty U(s, a) for the current batch
  - Compute loss = MSE(Q(s, a), y) + lambda_uncertainty * UncertaintyPenalty(U) + lambda_rank * RankOnePenalty()
  - Backpropagate and update Q-network weights
  - Optionally update the uncertainty estimator
  - If step % target_update == 0: update target network
  - Log metrics (loss, Q-values, uncertainty, etc.)
- End

Hyperparameters and Tuning
- Learning rate: controls the pace of learning. Start with a modest value (e.g., 3e-4) and adjust based on convergence behavior.
- Gamma (discount factor): typically 0.95 to 0.99 for many offline RL tasks.
- Lambda_uncertainty: weight for the uncertainty regularization term. Increase if uncertainty strongly influences stability.
- Lambda_rank: weight for rank-one regularization to maintain a compact architecture.
- Ensemble size (if using ensembles): 5‚Äì10 networks are common starting points; more ensembles yield more robust uncertainty estimates but increase compute.
- Target update period: 1000 steps is a typical starting point; adjust for dataset stability.
- Batch size: 256 is a common starting size; larger batches can improve gradient estimates but require more memory.

Reproducibility and Testing
- Seed management: Fix random seeds across all libraries (Python, NumPy, PyTorch) to ensure reproducibility.
- Deterministic operations: Where possible, enable deterministic algorithms in the deep learning framework.
- Checkpoints: Save model state and optimizer state at regular intervals. Load checkpoints to resume training.
- Evaluation protocol: Define a consistent offline evaluation protocol to compare results across experiments.
- Documentation of settings: Record all hyperparameters, dataset versions, and environment details to reproduce results.
